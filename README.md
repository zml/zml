# Bonjour üëã

At ZML, we are creating exciting AI products on top of our high-performance
AI inference stack. Our stack is built for production, using the amazing
[Zig](https://ziglang.org) language, [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org), and the
power of [Bazel](https://bazel.build).

  <div>Take me straight to <a href="#getting-started">getting started</a> or <a href="#a-taste-of-zml">give me a taste</a> ü•ê!</div>

# We're happy to share!
We're very happy to share our inference stack with the World and hope it allows
you, too, to build cool and exciting AI projects.

To give you a glimpse of what you can do with ZML, here is an early demo:

<div align="center"><img src="https://zml.ai/docs-assets/ZML.gif" style="width:75%"></div>

It shows a prototype running a LLaMA2 model sharded on 1 NVIDIA RTX 4090, 1 AMD
6800XT, and 1 Google Cloud TPU v2.  All accelerators were hosted in different
locations, with activations being passed over a VPN.

All processes used the same model code, cross-compiled on a Mac, and copied onto
the servers.

For more inspiration, see also the examples below or check out the
[examples](./examples) folder.



# Getting started



## Prerequisites

We use `bazel` to build ZML and its dependencies. The only prerequisite is
`bazel`, which we recommend to download through `bazelisk`, a version manager
for `bazel`.

**Please note: If you do not wish to install `bazel`** system-wide, we provide
[examples/bazel.sh](examples/bazel.sh) which downloads it to your home folder
and runs it.

**Install Bazel** (recommended):

<details><summary>

### macOS
</summary>

```
brew install bazelisk
```
</details>

<details><summary>

### Linux
</summary>

```
curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/bazel 'https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v1.20.0/bazelisk-linux-amd64'
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bazel
```
</details>


## Run a pre-packaged model

We have implemented a variety of example models in ZML. See our reference
implementations in the
[examples](https://github.com/zml/zml/tree/master/examples/) folder.

### MNIST

The [classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) handwritten digits
recognition task. The model is tasked to recognize a handwritten digit, which
has been converted to a 28x28 pixel monochrome image. `Bazel` will download a
pre-trained model, and the test dataset. The program will load the model,
compile it, and classify a randomly picked example from the test dataset.

On the command line:

```
cd examples
bazel run -c opt //mnist

# or
./bazel.sh run -c opt //mnist
```



### TinyLlama, Stories 15M

Our LLM examples start with a small model trained specifically on children's
history books. This model has been trained by [Andrej
Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy); you can read more about it on his
[GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c).

```
cd examples
bazel run -c opt //llama:TinyLlama-Stories-15M
bazel run -c opt //llama:TinyLlama-Stories-15M -- --prompt="Once upon a time, there was a cute little dragon"
```

### OpenLLama 3B

```
cd examples
bazel run -c opt //llama:OpenLLaMA-3B
bazel run -c opt //llama:OpenLLaMA-3B -- --prompt="Once upon a time,"
```

### Meta Llama 3 8B

This model has restrictions, see
[here](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B). It **requires
approval from Meta on Huggingface**, which can take a few hours to get granted.

While waiting, you can already generate an access token to log into HuggingFace
from `bazel`; see [here](./docs/huggingface-access-token.md).

Once you've been granted access, you're ready to download a gated model like
`Meta-Llama-3-8b`!

```
# requires token in $HOME/.cache/huggingface/token, as created by the
# `huggingface-cli login` command, or the `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` environment variable.
cd examples
bazel run -c opt //llama:Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
bazel run -c opt //llama:Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct -- --prompt="Once upon a time,"
```


## Running Models on GPU / TPU

You can compile models for accelerator runtimes by appending one or more of the
following arguments to the command line when compiling / running a model:

- NVIDIA CUDA: `--@zml//runtimes:cuda=true`
- AMD RoCM: `--@zml//runtimes:rocm=true`
- Google TPU: `--@zml//runtimes:tpu=true`
- **AVOID CPU:** `--@zml//runtimes:cpu=false`

The latter, avoiding compilation for CPU, cuts down compilation time.

So, to run the OpenLLama model from above on your host sporting an NVIDIA GPU,
run the following:

```
cd examples
bazel run -c opt //llama:OpenLLaMA-3B        \
          --@zml//runtimes:cuda=true         \
          -- --prompt="Once upon a time,"
```


## Run Tests

```
bazel test //zml:test
```


# A taste of ZML



## MNIST


```zig
const std = @import("std");
const zml = @import("zml");

/// Model definition
const Mnist = struct {
    fc1: Layer,
    fc2: Layer,

    const Layer = struct {
        weight: zml.Tensor,
        bias: zml.Tensor,

        pub fn forward(self: Layer, input: zml.Tensor) zml.Tensor {
            return self.weight.matmul(input).add(self.bias).relu();
        }
    };

    /// just two linear layers + relu activation
    pub fn forward(self: Mnist, input: zml.Tensor) zml.Tensor {
        std.log.info("Compiling for target: {s}", .{@tagName(input.getContext().target())});
        var x = input.flattenAll().convert(.f32);
        const layers: []const Layer = &.{ self.fc1, self.fc2 };
        for (layers) |layer| {
            x = zml.call(layer, .forward, .{x});
        }
        return x.argMax(0, .u8).indices;
    }
};
```



## Tagged Tensors

```zig
const Sdpa = struct {
    pub fn forward(_: Sdpa, ctx: *zml.Context, q_: zml.Tensor, k_: zml.Tensor, v_: zml.Tensor) zml.Tensor {
        const q = q_.withTags(.{ .b, .h, .q, .hd });
        const k = k_.withTags(.{ .b, .h, .k, .hd });
        const v = v_.withTags(.{ .b, .h, .k, .hd });
        const attn_mask = zml.nn.causalAttnMask(ctx, .{ .q = q.dim(.q), .k = k.dim(.k) }, q.dtype(), null);
        return zml.nn.sdpa(ctx, q, k, v, .{ .attn_mask = attn_mask });
    }
};
```
