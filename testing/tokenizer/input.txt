50 Lan (traditional Chinese: 50嵐; simplified Chinese: 50岚) is a Taiwanese bubble tea chain. In 1994, Ma Shao-wei, the founder, and his sister Ma Ya-fang, started a juice and tea street stall next to their mother's fried chicken stall in Tainan, a city in southern Taiwan. They switched to focusing on selling only tea and as business improved, upgraded from a street stall to a terrace. The first 50 Lan store opened in 1997 and a second opened the next year. Over ten branches opened in Tainan after friends and relatives wanted to become franchisees.
The company's headquarters is in Tainan and there are four regional divisions that function separately. Guo Zong-feng, Ma's army friend, started a company in 2000 to manage branches in Kaohsiung and Pingtung. Ma Ya-fen, Ma's sister, formed a management company in 2002 to oversee branches in Central District, Changhua, Chiayi County, and Yunlin County. In 2003, Ma's university classmate began managing branches in the Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area, while Ma's sister Ma Ya-fang started overseeing branches in the Taoyuan–Hsinchu area. There were 612 50 Lan stores in Taiwan by 2024.
To expand the chain outside of Taiwan, Ma Ya-fen in 2006 created the sister brand KOI Thé [zh-yue] which operates in a number of Southeast Asia countries and Fiftylan, which operates in the United States. Guo Zong-feng separately expanded the chain to the United States through Wushiland Boba in 2016. To expand to mainland China, Lou Gengshen, who managed 50 Lan's Taipei branches, founded 1 Diandian (Chinese: 1點點) in 2010.
50 Lan's founder, Ma Shao-wei (Chinese: 馬紹維),[a] had attended the aerospace engineering department at Tamkang University. Upon finishing his military service, he moved back to Tainan, where he had grown up.[2] Ma initially worked with his father in the recycled gold business but found that profits were slim. In 1993, his mother opened a fried chicken stall outside her home at Tainan's Dexing Road (Chinese: 德興路) through which she made a monthly net profit of between NT$100,000 (US$3,580) and NT$200,000 (US$7,160).[1][3] Investing NT$10,000 (US$358), Ma Shao-wei and his sister, Ma Ya-fang (Chinese: 馬雅芳),[b] launched a juice and tea stall alongside their mother's fried chicken stall in 1994.[1] Ma Shao-wei opted to focus on the tea market after realizing the labor-intensive nature of beverage preparation and facing challenges in sourcing fresh fruit and additional raw ingredients.[2]
Ma Shao-wei's family suggested that he choose a name for the tea stall. He was browsing a Japanese magazine and found the name "50 Lan" (Chinese: 五十嵐) memorable.[1] Thinking that "even Grandma can remember it", Ma selected 50 Lan as the name six months after it had opened.[1][4] As business improved, they upgraded from a street stall to a terrace.[1] Ma and his sister launched the inaugural 50 Lan store in 1997 on Tainan's Xinxiao Road (Chinese: 新孝路). They started the second location in 1998.[3] Friends and relatives expressed interest in franchising, leading to the launch of over ten 50 Lan outlets in Tainan.[1]
Guo Zong-feng (Chinese: 郭宗峰),[1] who had served with Ma in the army, purchased the right to operate 50 Lan in the Gaoping region in 2000, which introduced the Tainan-based beverage store to additional cities and counties. Ma's Tainan locations of 50 Lan were often situated in alleys. On the other hand, Guo and his wife placed their Kaohsiung 50 Lan stores along roads that did not have traffic islands. This swiftly increased brand recognition since vehicles moved at slow speeds along these roads and there was convenient parking.[2] The Business Today [zh] journalist Wan Bei-lin said that it was under Guo Zong-feng's efforts that 50 Lan gained recognition.[1]
Ma Ya-fen [zh] (Chinese: 馬雅芬), Ma Shao-wei's sister, later became a leader at 50 Lan.[c] After graduating from the French department of Tamkang University, she began her career at The Westin Taipei before becoming a front desk attendant and cashier at a Taichung hotel affiliated with EVA Air. Observing 50 Lan's fast growth in Kaohsiung, Ma suggested to her brother that 50 Lan be brought to Taichung.[2] To prepare for leading this expansion, she moved back to the company's headerquarters in Tainan for six months of training.[1][2] Ma became proficient in brewing tea by working as a front-line worker between 7 am and 10 pm. She reviewed Ray Kroc's book about McDonald's development and assembled her brother's standard operating procedures into a small book. As she acquired the skills to operate an outlet by herself, she set the drinks' ice and sweetness ratios.[2]
Ma Ya-fen began recruiting the initial 10 franchisees for 50 Lan's Taichung branches in 2002. Aiming to train the employees from the ground up, she mimicked EVA Air's recruitment approach of choosing college graduates below the age of 30 who were beginning their careers. The candidates were required to spend three days in the kitchen prior to securing a site. Applicants who were overly adamant on their selected site would be turned down.[2] The first Taichung branch struggled in its first month with customers complaining about the cost. Since her brother had required the use of higher-quality ingredients such as creamer and tea leaves, 50 Lan's drinks cost NT$5 (US$0.18) more than competitors' drinks. Revenue grew in the second and third months as customers returned and spread word about the business.[7] As staff members at the franchised outlets sought to launch their 50 Lan shops, Ma required them to obtain the franchisee's backing. She grew 50 Lan's footprint to the urban regions in Taiwan's northern and central parts.[2]
50 Lan had 28 stores by 2004 in Taiwan's central part which discontinued taking on additional franchise partners. It instead launched company-owned outlets and permitted existing franchisees to open additional locations. Rather than receiving dues from the franchisees, the central office bills franchisees for the raw materials they buy.[2] Only employees were allowed to become franchise owners.[1] They had to work for the company for at least two years as well as pass an evaluation.[3] Mao Shao-wei gave a university classmate the right to manage 50 Lan branches in Taipei in 2003. Ma Ya-fang, the younger sister who had established the fruit stall with him, secured the right to manage stores in the Taoyuan–Hsinchu area in 2005.[1]
During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, numerous Taiwanese shoppers refused to patronize bubble tea stores that backed China's one country, two systems strategy for Hong Kong which China wishes eventually to implement in Taiwan. When some bubble tea franchise owners supported the protests, Chinese netizens urged Chinese consumers to avoid those businesses. 50 Lan stated the company was founded in Taiwan, China.[8]
In 2011, 50 Lan was Taiwan's second-biggest tea brand behind Ching-Shin Fu-Chuan [zh], which serves "pure" tea and had 1,000 branches.[9] The data firm LnData in 2023 recorded that in Taiwan there were 61 bubble tea brands. During that year's initial three quarters, 50 Lan purchases made up 24.3% of the bubble tea sales. According to LnData, 50 Lan occupied the number one spot in Taiwan's bubble tea market and over that year was the most sought-after choice among every age demographic.[2] By 2024, there were 612 50 Lan stores in Taiwan.[2] Significant competitors of 50 Lan are Chatime and Ching-Shin Fu-Chuan.[10] Other chains competing in the Taiwanese bubble tea market are The Alley, CoCo Fresh Tea & Juice, Gong Cha, and Yifang Taiwan Fruit Tea.[11]
