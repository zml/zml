# Vectored DmaMapped Loader Context

Snapshot: 2026-07-21. ZML is checked out detached at `a82aed0f`
(`io: make oneAPI buffer sizing source agnostic`) with the uncommitted loader
work described here. XLA is clean at `b0990b33b1`
(`[XLA:GPU][oneAPI] Enable PJRT_Client_DmaMap for SYCL`). XLA was neither
modified nor built during this work.

This file is the authoritative handoff for the current implementation and
measurements. `RESEARCH.md` is historical controller research; its adaptive
staging architecture is retired.

## Outcome

CUDA and oneAPI now use a static, bounded vectored path:

```text
large positional source range
    -> iovec of small client-DmaMapped blocks
    -> immediate asynchronous PJRT transfers
    -> final destination shards/replicas
```

The pageable staging queue, staging copies, DMA-lane controller, adaptive
probes, per-device pinned pools, and old staged/direct writers were removed.
Other targets retain the ordinary buffered loader.

Measured presets are deliberately static:

```text
                         local/default       S3/HF/GCS high latency
read_parallelism              12                       32
read_request_size          2 MiB                   16 MiB
dma_block_size             2 MiB                    2 MiB
max_pinned_bytes         128 MiB                  512 MiB
```

There is no single request size or concurrency within 3% of the best local and
remote results. Keep the explicit controls rather than recreating an automatic
controller without a separate design. Library and IO-example defaults use the
local preset because it is the only tested fixed default that avoids a B70
warm-file regression. `bench_s3.sh` supplies the remote preset by default; all
four values remain overridable.

The public `LoadOpts` fields are now only:

- `read_parallelism = 12`
- `read_request_size = 2 MiB`
- `dma_block_size = 2 MiB`
- `max_pinned_bytes = 128 MiB`
- `shardings`, `progress`, and `total_bytes`

Removed fields are `initial_parallelism`, `adaptive_parallelism`,
`max_read_parallelism`, `read_chunk_size`, `max_staging_bytes`,
`max_pinned_buffers_per_device`, `pinned_buffer_size`, and
`transfer_quantum_size`.

## Implementation

### Exact vectored reads

`zml/safetensors.zig` adds `TensorReader.readPositionalAllV`.

- The combined tensor-relative range and backing-file offset use checked
  arithmetic.
- Empty in-bounds reads succeed; out-of-bounds and overflow fail.
- Partial reads resume at the exact slice and intra-slice offset.
- Local calls are split at the platform `IOV_MAX`.
- Unexpected EOF is reported only after all actual progress is consumed.
- Positional calls do not disturb the sequential reader position.

Generic HTTP range reads now fill every supplied slice. A `206` must have a
covering `Content-Range`; a server returning `200` and ignoring `Range` is
handled by discarding the requested prefix before scattering. S3, GCS, and HF
continue to use their existing internal scatter/chunk readers.

The vectored loader opens each distinct backing file once and gives tensor
readers borrowed positional-only handles. This is safe because positional
reads do not mutate streaming position. It is important remotely: Llama 3.1
8B has 291 tensors but only four safetensor files, so per-tensor opens caused
291 object `HEAD` requests. Shared handles reduced the 1000 ms S3Proxy run from
49.03 s to 41.72 s.

### Reservation planner

`VectoredRequestPlan` is a pure planner over `DispatchSpans`.

- It accepts any tensor source range, including ranges crossing shard and DMA
  block boundaries.
- Scatter entries remain in global source/file order.
- Each DMA block contains bytes contiguous in one final destination layout and
  records the exact destination shard/replica mask and final offset.
- Replicated destinations reuse one host block; the block has one reference
  per submitted device transfer.
- Multiple requests from one tensor may complete out of order.

Final-transfer handling is per destination. A destination's final block waits
until the sum of all earlier submitted byte ranges reaches its final offset;
only then is it submitted with PJRT's `is_last_transfer=true`. Finals for one
tensor do not wait for unrelated tensors, which avoids pin-pool deadlocks.

### DMA pool and completion

`zml/mem.zig` adds one load-scoped pool shared by every device of the PJRT
client.

- Host memory is allocated in lazy slabs of up to 64 MiB, registered once via
  `PJRT_Client_DmaMap`, and divided into fixed independent blocks.
- The hard byte limit includes all mapped blocks, not only currently leased
  blocks.
- A request reserves all blocks atomically or waits without retaining a
  partial reservation.
- PJRT completion callbacks decrement reference-counted leases; only the last
  replica callback returns a block.
- Slab storage uses raw allocation so Zig does not poison/memset memory that a
  source read immediately overwrites.
- Pool close wakes blocked reservations. On failure the coordinator stops new
  work, drains active reads and events, aborts deferred transfers, marks
  unfinished PJRT buffers with an error, then destroys events/managers and
  finally unmaps slabs.

A 128 MiB pool made from two 64 MiB mappings completed sharded and replicated
loads across all four B70s. This validates that subranges of one registered slab
are accepted by all devices in this oneAPI client.

### Coordinator and metrics

The coordinator owns `min(read_parallelism, request_count)` long-lived workers;
it does not create a task per request. Jobs are round-robin by tensor, so one
large tensor can fill idle width. A worker lazily opens a shared source,
initializes the tensor's PJRT transfer managers once, performs one exact
vectored read, and immediately submits its DMA blocks. The global pinned pool
is the only read/DMA backpressure mechanism.

Useful logged metrics are source operations/bytes/latency, active/peak reads,
DMA submissions/bytes/latency, submitted and committed bytes, pinned high-water
and mapped bytes, pool waits/time, logical completion, and wall time.

## Code map

- `zml/io.zig`: `LoadOpts`, planner, lazy source/tensor states, coordinator,
  PJRT final/error handling, buffered fallback, and planner/final tests.
- `zml/mem.zig`: `DmaBlockPool`, slab mapping, atomic bulk reservations, and
  lease/refcount tests.
- `zml/safetensors.zig`: exact positional scatter API, borrowed positional
  readers, and bounds/partial/EOF/IOV tests.
- `zml/io/vfs/http.zig`: complete scatter filling and strict range response
  validation.
- `zml/io/vfs/parallel_read.zig`: scatter chunk validation.
- `pjrt/pjrt.zig`: helper for setting unfinished async buffers to an unknown
  PJRT error.
- `examples/io/main.zig`: the four static environment controls.
- `bench_file.sh`, `profile_file.sh`: local defaults; `PERF_DATA` prevents
  overwriting a caller's profile.
- `bench_s3.sh`: remote defaults and latency/bandwidth controls.

## Performance results

Model: Llama 3.1 8B, 14.96 GiB logical weights. Local numbers use warm page
cache. Medians are wall-clock goodput reported by `examples/io`.

### Pre-replacement baseline

Five balanced runs of the old adaptive/staging loader:

| Placement | Median | Individual wall times |
|---|---:|---|
| one B70 | 25.31 GiB/s | 590.969, 591.014, 591.071, 565.594, 592.490 ms |
| four B70 sharded | 24.72 GiB/s | 1.032 s outlier, 605.183, 604.719, 605.316, 580.092 ms |

The separately measured parallel page-cache ceiling on this machine is about
30-31 GiB/s.

### Final local configuration

Configuration: 12 reads, 2 MiB request, 2 MiB block, 128 MiB pinned.

| Placement | Five runs | Median |
|---|---|---:|
| one B70 | 26.57, 25.52, 27.01, 26.47, 25.22 GiB/s | **26.47 GiB/s** |
| four B70 sharded | 26.62, 26.63, 27.16, 25.86, 22.43 GiB/s | **26.62 GiB/s** |
| four B70 replicated | 11.93, 11.87, 11.84, 10.98, 11.58 GiB/s | **11.84 GiB/s** |

The four-B70 sharded median is 7.7% above the old 24.72 GiB/s median and reaches
about 86% of the measured page-cache ceiling. Replicated goodput is logical;
the loader physically transfers 59.83 GiB to four devices.

### Sweeps

The required first block sweep held request/read width/pinned at
32 MiB/32/1 GiB. Five-run medians were:

| DMA block | 1 MiB | 2 MiB | 4 MiB | 8 MiB | 32 MiB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| GiB/s | 13.64 | 14.51 | 14.62 | 14.81 | 14.98 |

That point is misleading in isolation: large blocks waste most of each lease
when the request is smaller, while 32 large concurrent requests consume the
whole 1 GiB pool. Repeating the block sweep at the selected 2 MiB request and
12-read point found the interaction:

| DMA block | 1 MiB | 2 MiB | 4 MiB | 8 MiB | 32 MiB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| median GiB/s | 16.14 | **25.36** | 24.54 | 22.03 | 22.46 |

At 2 MiB request/block and 128 MiB pinned, read-width medians were:

| Reads | 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 24 | 32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| median GiB/s | 20.73 | 22.14 | **25.67** | 21.92 | 20.61 | 19.62 |

At 12 reads, 2 MiB block, and 128 MiB pinned, request medians were:

| Request | 2 MiB | 4 MiB | 8 MiB | 16 MiB | 32 MiB | 64 MiB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| median GiB/s | **25.10** | 22.82 | 20.61 | 17.52 | 14.90 | 11.48 |

Pinned-limit medians at 12 reads and 2 MiB request/block were:

| Limit | 128 MiB | 256 MiB | 512 MiB | 1 GiB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| median GiB/s | **25.68** | 25.52 | 25.18 | 24.98 |

The lowest-memory candidate is also the fastest. The later final five-run
median improved to 26.47 GiB/s after shared source handles and normal run
variance.

### S3Proxy

The selected remote configuration is 32 reads, 16 MiB requests, 2 MiB blocks,
and 512 MiB pinned. It was within 0.2% of 32 MiB/32 reads/1 GiB at 10 and 250 ms
while using half the registered memory. A 64 MiB/24-read/1 GiB candidate was
slower.

| S3Proxy profile | Final runs | Final median/time | Old controller |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| 10 ms / 1000 MiB/s | 2.691, 2.688, 2.689 s | **2.689 s / 5.56 GiB/s** | 2.912 s median |
| 250 ms / 1000 MiB/s | 11.105, 11.102, 11.099 s | **11.102 s / 1.35 GiB/s** | 11.462 s |
| 1000 ms / 100 MiB/s | one validation | **41.724 s / 367 MiB/s** | 43.175 s |

The full 10 ms discovery pass rose from 1.17 GiB/s at 2 MiB/12 reads to
5.40-5.41 GiB/s at 16-32 MiB/32 reads before source-handle sharing. This is why
the request-size knob remains explicit.

### `perf`

Final recordings:

- `/tmp/zml-vectored-final-1b70.data`
- `/tmp/zml-vectored-final-4b70.data`
- old four-B70 baseline: `/tmp/zml-vectored-baseline-4b70.data`

Flat cycle profiles:

| Symbol | old four B70 | final one B70 | final four B70 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `_copy_to_iter` | 67.06% | 70.55% | 64.28% |
| `filemap_get_read_batch` | 3.81% | 6.15% | 5.55% |
| `copy_page_to_iter` | 1.79% | 2.76% | 2.55% |
| `filemap_read` | 1.53% | 2.60% | 2.39% |
| `std::vector<...>::resize` | 1.72% | <0.5% | 1.64% |
| `xe_hw_fence_signaled` | <0.5% | <0.5% | 0.57% |

No pageable staging copy, userspace sharding copy, or slab poison/memset appears
in the final profiles. The remaining dominant CPU cost is Linux copying warm
page-cache pages into DmaMapped anonymous memory. DmaMap pins/registers those
pages for device access; it does not let ordinary file-backed page-cache pages
become the PJRT transfer source without this kernel copy.

Selected `perf stat` comparison:

| Counter | old one B70 | final one B70 | old four B70 | final four B70 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| task-clock | 6.284 s | 7.602 s | 8.089 s | 8.321 s |
| cycles | 32.906 G | 39.506 G | 42.105 G | 43.298 G |
| instructions | 5.158 G | 5.549 G | 10.420 G | 10.911 G |
| context switches | 42,162 | 30,638 | 39,594 | 41,270 |
| CPU migrations | 3,558 | 1,369 | 2,680 | 1,946 |
| page faults | 275,781 | 278,678 | 985,254 | 988,597 |

The one-device path spends more aggregate CPU on many 2 MiB reads/transfers,
but finishes faster. In the sharded case—the original CPU concern—task-clock
is only 2.9% higher while median wall goodput is 7.7% higher, and the staging
and sharding copies are gone.

One initial post-change profile and the fifth pass of an early request-width
sweep were invalidated when another user's 32-way XLA/oneAPI compiler job
saturated the host. `/tmp/zml-vectored-new-1b70.data` is retained only as a
contaminated artifact and was not used for final conclusions.

## Rejected hypotheses and retained observations

- DmaMap itself did not make CPU writes materially slower. It changes page
  registration/device visibility, not the basic CPU cache hierarchy.
- Anonymous DmaMapped memory means ordinary anonymous virtual memory allocated
  by ZML and then registered with PJRT; it is not file-backed and not a hidden
  staging allocation.
- Huge pages reduce translation/registration pressure but do not remove the
  page-cache-to-anonymous copy or make CPU writes bypass cache coherency.
- A file-backed mmap used directly for DMA reached about 21.4 GiB/s; mmap plus
  an explicit copy reached about 23.7 GiB/s. Neither beat the final preadv into
  DmaMapped blocks.
- The useful local 12-read knee is a pipeline balance, not twelve dedicated DMA
  engines. Reads and transfers overlap, while the one global byte budget owns
  blocks through read, ready, and PJRT completion states.
- Per-device pools are unnecessary for this client: one DmaMapped slab was used
  successfully by all four B70 devices. A future PJRT client spanning distinct
  driver handles would need separate runtime validation.

## Validation and commands

Passed after the final edits:

```text
./bazel.sh test //zml:test //zml/io/vfs:test
./bazel.sh build --config=release --@zml//platforms:oneapi=true \
  //examples/io:playground //examples/mnist:mnist
./bazel.sh build --config=release --@zml//platforms:cuda=true \
  //examples/io:playground //examples/mnist:mnist
```

Four-device oneAPI sharded and replicated loads completed repeatedly. CUDA
release compilation passes, but this host has no RTX GPU, so the requested RTX
5090 runtime sweep remains for the CUDA machine.

Useful runs:

```text
# Local/default; all values may still be overridden.
./bench_file.sh

# Remote preset selected by the proxy sweep.
LATENCY_MS=10 SPEED_MIB=1000 ./bench_s3.sh

# Preserve workspace perf.data by choosing a different output.
PERF_DATA=/tmp/zml-loader.data ./profile_file.sh

# Four B70s.
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR='level_zero:*' ./bench_file.sh
```

## Workspace boundary

Preserve unrelated user changes in `platforms/oneapi/oneapi.bzl` and
`zml/module.zig`. The user's benchmark selector changes remain; the scripts now
also carry the selected static presets. Workspace `perf.data` and
`perf.data.old` were not overwritten or removed. The accidental
`CTX.md.orig` is deleted as requested. Do not build or modify XLA in follow-up
work unless the user explicitly changes that instruction.
