# How to port Pytorch models to ZML ?


## Requirements

We assume you already have a working ZML project,
and you can run it with a Bazel command like `bazel run //my_project:torch2zml`.
You can refer to [write your first model](../tutorials/write_first_model.md) to do so.
We also assume that you know enough Python to run the reference implementation.

## Overview

Porting Neural Network implementations can be tedious. Some small errors can
degrade the output of the model, in subtle or not so subtle ways. To track down
errors in a model with four thousand layers, we best be organized.

By the way if you are interested in a specific model, be careful that not all
implementations of a model you can find on Github are equivalent. Sometimes
people introduce subtle bugs when porting across Python libraries. Ideally use
the author's implementation, or at least one you have tested yourself.

**The recommended process is as follows:**

1. run the reference implementation on a known input, and sample layer activations
2. start a ZML project and load the sampled reference activations
3. start porting layers one by one, and test individual layers
4. end-to-end test the model

## Sampling reference activations

Pytorch exposes "forward hooks" that allow to inspect the input/output of each
`torch.nn.Module`. That way it is possible to create a dictionary with each
layer input/output, keyed by the name of the layer.

The main caveat is that if you have a functional implementation that doesn't
use `torch.nn.Module`, this technique won't work.

It is the easiest to start from a "huggingface" snippet, or a python script
that calls the model of your choice on an example input. eg:



```python
import torch
import transformers

model_path = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B"

pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model_path,
    model_kwargs={"torch_dtype": torch.float16},
    # device="cuda",
    token=token,
)

prompt = "Q: What is the largest animal?\nA:"
output = pipeline(prompt)
print(output)
```

Then edit the script to import [zml_utils](https://github.com/zml/zml/blob/master/tools/zml_utils.py).

`zml_utils.py` is standalone and currently it's not distributed as a python
package, so the simplest way to use it, is to copy it next to your python
script. Then wrap the model/pipeline in a `zml_utils.ActivationCollector`. The
collector wraps the given model, and returns the original results AND the
activations in a dict of `torch.Tensor` when it's being called. After that, you
can save those activations to a `.pt` file.

```python
import torch
import transformers
import zml_utils

model_path = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B"

pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model_path,
    model_kwargs={"torch_dtype": torch.float16},
    # device="cuda",
)
model, tokenizer = pipeline.model, pipeline.tokenizer

prompt = "Q: What is the largest animal?\nA:"
# Wrap the pipeline, and extract activations.
# Activations files can be huge for big models,
# so let's stop collecting after 1000 layers.
pipeline = zml_utils.ActivationCollector(pipeline, max_layers=1000, stop_after_first_step=True)
output, activations = pipeline(prompt)

# `output` can be `None` if activations collection
# has stopped before the end of the inference
if output:
    print(output)

# Save activations to a file.
filename = model_path.split("/")[-1] + ".activations.pt"
torch.save(activations, filename)
print(f"Saved {len(activations)} activations to {filename}")
```

Run this script: `python activations.py`

If you're using HuggingFace, make note of the local path where the model is
saved, it should be something like `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/...`. (and should
appear on the console when running the script). We will need it in the next
steps.

## Loading model and activations in ZML

Let's create a basic ZML program that loads the activations and the Pytorch
model. Put the following in `my_project/torch2zml.zig`.

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const log = std.log;

const asynk = @import("async");
const zml = @import("zml");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    try asynk.AsyncThread.main(gpa.allocator(), asyncMain, .{});
}

pub fn asyncMain() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    const args = try std.process.argsAlloc(allocator);
    defer std.process.argsFree(allocator, args);

    const model_path, const activations_path = args[1..3].*;

    const activations = try zml.aio.torch.open(allocator, activations_path);
    defer activations.deinit();
    log.info("Found {} activations in {s}", .{ activations.buffers.count(), activations_path });

    const model_weights = try zml.aio.detectFormatAndOpen(allocator, model_path);
    defer model_weights.deinit();
    log.info("Found {} model layers in {s}", .{ model_weights.buffers.count(), activations_path });
}
```

And add a `zig_cc_binary` target in `my_project/BUILD.bazel`:

```python
load("@zml//bazel:zig.bzl", "zig_cc_binary")

zig_cc_binary(
    name = "torch2zml",
    main = "torch2zml.zig",
    deps = [
        "@zml//async",
        "@zml//zml",
    ],
)
```

Now check that the weights can be loaded correctly using the bazel CLI.

```bash
bazel build //my_project:torch2zml
./bazel-bin/my_project/torch2zml /path/to/my/model.safetensors.index.json ./my_project/Meta-Llama-3-8B.activations.pt

info: Found 1108 activations in /Users/guw/Documents/zml/models/torch2zml/Meta-Llama-3-8B.activations.pt
debug(zml_io): Loading shard: model-00004-of-00004.safetensors
debug(zml_io): Loading shard: model-00001-of-00004.safetensors

info: Found 291 model layers in /Users/guw/Documents/zml/models/torch2zml/Meta-Llama-3-8B.activations.pt
```

## Loading an individual layer

In the above Zig code, the `model_weights` struct is a wrapper around a flat
dictionary, containing an entry for each tensor in the model (similar to a
"state dict"). Manipulating a dictionary is generally not very convenient, so
let's convert it to a Zig struct.

Declare the following layer at the bottom of your file:

```zig
const Mlp = struct {
    up_proj: zml.nn.Linear,
    gate_proj: zml.nn.Linear,
    down_proj: zml.nn.Linear,
};
```

The `zml.nn.Linear` is the equivalent of `torch.nn.Linear` and is defined by
its `weight` and optional `bias` tensors.

To create such a struct from our `model_weights` dictionary, we can use the
`zml.aio.populateModelWithPrefix` helper:

```zig
pub fn asyncMain() !void {
    ...
    const mlp_shape = try zml.aio.populateModelWithPrefix(Mlp, allocator, model_weights, "model.layers.0.mlp");
    log.info("layer.0.mlp: {}", .{mlp_shape});
}
```

Build and run, using previous commands.

Typical errors are of the form _"Layer not found: ..."_. This is typically due
to the naming of layers in Zig not matching the naming in the file.
Double-check everything and don't hesitate to print more things, e.g. in the
Python script. Alternatively, Huggingface's web-interface allows to peek into
`.safetensor` files.


## Testing an individual layer

Finally, we are going to write the actual math code for our `MLP` layer.

```zig
const Mlp = struct {
    up_proj: zml.nn.Linear,
    gate_proj: zml.nn.Linear,
    down_proj: zml.nn.Linear,

    pub fn forward(self: Mlp, x: Tensor) Tensor {
        const proj = zml.call(self.up_proj, .forward, .{x});
        var output = zml.call(self.gate_proj, .forward, .{x});
        output = output.silu().mul(proj);
        return zml.call(self.down_proj, .forward, .{output});
    }
};
```

Note that we use `zml.call` instead of directly calling
`self.up_proj.forward(x)`. Calling `forward` directly results in the same
computation happening at runtime; but going through `zml.call` allows ZML to
generate an MLIR representation that is closer to the Zig code and therefore
easier to read.

We can test the MLP layer with the `zml.testing.testLayer` utility:

```zig
pub fn asyncMain() !void {
    ...
    
    var ctx = try zml.Context.init();
    defer ctx.deinit();
    const platform = ctx.autoPlatform(.{});
    const mlp_weights = try zml.aio.loadModelBuffers(Mlp, mlp_shape, model_weights, allocator, platform);

    zml.testing.testLayer(platform, activations, "model.layers.0.mlp", mlp_shape, mlp_weights, 1e-3);
}
```

During this phase, you have three kinds of errors that can appear:

* Zig compilation errors: we've all been there, learning a new language
  can be tough. Normally, the compiler should help you figure out what's wrong.
  You can also check [ZML concepts](../learn/concepts.md) that explains types used
  by ZML.
* Buffer not found errors: be careful that you need to use
  the naming scheme of the inference pipeline when loading the activations.
  Depending on how you write your code, you may have a different naming
  convention in the model file and in the activation file. This is because in
  Python, and in particular the `transformers` library, it's not uncommon to
  wrap the model in a `Pipeline` object before using it. So a given layer may
  be named `layer.0.mlp` in the model file, but its activations may be saved
  under `model.layer.0.mlp`.
* MLIR compilation errors: typically this is caused by a mathematical
  error in the `forward` function. To help here, you can log the shapes of the
  input and intermediary values: `std.log.info("x: {}", .{x})`, and put similar
  print statements in the Python code. You can also consider splitting a big
  layer into smaller parts. Since our code only explicitly captures
  `torch.nn.Module` input/output, you may need to modify the Python script to
  add some extra tensors to the dictionary with example input/output of a
  specific function.

## General tips

* Porting models can be hard, especially if the original code is messy, has
  poor comments, behaves differently on different input shapes, or has unused
  code paths. Start by identifying parts of the Python code which are
  **unused**. It is common in research code that some code paths were written
  for one paper, but didn't get used in subsequent papers.

* ZML offers a few Pytorch specific helpers in `zml.torch`; those operators are
  offered to help you port models, but in general they may have weird APIs. If
  you're lucky and the code you are porting has comments indicating "tags", eg
  "C,W,H" of tensors, you can port this to actual tensor attributes using
  `x.withTags(.{.c, .w, .h})`, and use those tags (eg `.c`) to refer to axes
  instead of offsets. E.g. in Pytorch: `x.sum(0) # reduce over channel axis`
  becomes `x.sum(.c)`. More on this topic in 
  ["Working with tensors"](../tutorials/working_with_tensors.md).
